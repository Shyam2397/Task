OBJECTS AND ITS INTERNAL REPRESENTATION IN JAVASCRIPT :


1. Objects, in JavaScript, are the most important data type and form the building blocks for modern JavaScript.
2. Objects are different than primitive datatypes (i.e. number, string, boolean, etc.).
3. Primitive data types contain one value but Objects can hold many values in form of Key: value pair.

For Example:


let Bike Details={

	Model= 'Yamaha FZS'
	Colour='Black'
	Maker='Yamaha'
	Seating='2'
	Engine no='F45D15445D55'
}

1. 'Model','colour','maker','seating','Engine no' are all 'KEYS' and 'Yamaha FZS','Black','Yamaha','2','F45D15445D55' are all 'VALUES'
2. objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs.
3. An object can be created with figure brackets {…}.

4. Notation by using 'dot notation' (Bike Details.'Model')
5. Notation by using 'Bracket Notation' (Bike Details['Model'])
